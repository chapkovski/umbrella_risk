            In this part, one of the wheels of fortune below determines one part of your bonus payoff. This outcome is
            independent of what else happens during this study. Please familiarize yourself with the possible outcomes
            for
            all the wheels relevant in this part.</div>
        <div>
            Before you can start this part you have to click on all the wheels of fortune to see their distribution of
            red
            and green areas. Once you have clicked on all wheels of fortune, the one relevant for this part will be
            highlighted.</div>

            {% if player.treatment == 'risk' %}
            As you can see the new wheel of fortune relevant for this part is {{player.risk}}% green and
            {{no_risk_perc}}% red. This means, you
            have <b>a {{player.risk}}% chance to win  {{Constants.max_payoff|c}}</b>  as an additional bonus if this part is chosen at the end of the experiment as
            payoff relevant.


            {% endif %}
            {% if player.treatment == 'control' %}

            As you can see the wheel of fortune relevant for this part is only green. This means, you will receive
            {{Constants.control_payoff|c}} for sure as an additional bonus, if this part is chosen at the end of the experiment as the
            payoff relevant part.


            {% endif %}
            {% if player.treatment == 'ambiguity' %}
            In this part we will not tell you which of the wheels will be payoff relevant. For this reason, the
            probabilities
            for winning and losing are unknown. They are somewhere between 1% and 99%. This means, the chance to win
            {{Constants.max_payoff|c}} as an additional bonus is between 1%-99% if this part is chosen at the end of the experiment as the
            payoff relevant part.
