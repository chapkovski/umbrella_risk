        The decisions in this experiment are not hypothetical. Your chooses determine how much money you will get at the
        end!
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        You will make repeated choices. Once you have made all of the choices, one of the choices will be selected at
        random, and the amount you receive will be determined according to your choice with another random draw. Hence,
        you should treat each choice as if it were the only one you make! Any choice could be the one that ultimately
        matters.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">There are no right or wrong answers! Choose the option that you prefer!
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">The experiment consists of altogether four decision making tasks, which are presented to
        you multiple times across three rounds. The rules of the task remain the same, but in each round there will be
        another source of payoffs. We will explain the details of the additional payoffs, once the round starts. Only
        once round will be chosen at the end and paid out.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">In all rounds you will face different wheels of fortune that determine an additional
        payoff. While you complete the decision making tasks, a lottery will be played. The lottery is depending on the
        outcome of the spinning wheel you see here: The wheels look like this:

        <img src="{% static 'global/img/example_circle.png'%}" alt="example of spinning wheel" height="200px"></div>
        </li>

    <li class="list-group-item">The wheels will spin while you make you decisions â€“ and each wheel will stop when you
        reach the end of the respective round. However, you will not learn the outcome until the end of the study.
