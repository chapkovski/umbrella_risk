      As stated at the beginning, for each room (task) you faced an additional lottery. It was randomly determined that the
lottery from room (task) {{participant.vars.payable_round}} is payoff relevant. Here you see this lottery’s outcome.

    <li class="list-group-item">
    From the choices you made, task X[random] was randomly determined to be paid out
