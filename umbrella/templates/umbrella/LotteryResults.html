NOTE FROM PHILIPP! this page will be shown
    as the very last page after all three treatments are played. 
    Here we show it for our own internal debugging reasons (so we don't need to go through all
    the decisions before seeing it!)</div>

<ul class="list-group list-group-flush my-3">
    <li class="list-group-item">
      As stated at the beginning, for each room (task) you faced an additional lottery. It was randomly determined that the
lottery from room (task) {{participant.vars.payable_round}} is payoff relevant. Here you see this lotteryâ€™s outcome.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
    {% include 'umbrella/includes/singlecircle.html' with result=True risk=player.payable_risk lottery_outcome=player.payable_lottery_outcome  cover=False %}</li>
      <li class="list-group-item ">
   
       Thus your payoff from this additional lottery  is <b>{{player.background_payoff }}</b>.

    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
    From the choices you made, task  {{player.payable_task_num}} was randomly determined to be paid out.


    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item ">
   
       Your payoff from this task is <b>{{player.felix_payoff}}</b>.

    </li>

    <li class="list-group-item font-weight-bold ">
   
        Hence, your final payoff is: {{player.payoff}}.

    </li>
</ul>
